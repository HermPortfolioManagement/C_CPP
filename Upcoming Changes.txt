I will be adding new branches to separate code languages

Purposes:

To more easily set up workspaces that different IDEs understand
To allow those looking to jump into whatever language(s) is/are relevant to them
To simulate an environment of least priviledge

Do note that I'm still learning github, and I'm in school, so it may take a while.

This is a growing portfolio of Thomas Joseph Herm Jr, and will likely predominately contain code I wrote for U of L courses, and Linkedin Courses.

I try to take things a step further than course requirements, and promote good reability, organization, security, and documentation when helpful.

# Upcoming Changes

* Adding new branches to separate code languages
* Changing 'readme.txt's to 'readme.md's

## Purposes of code separation:

* To more easily set up workspaces that different IDEs understand
* To allow those looking to jump into whatever language(s) is/are relevant to them
* To simulate an environment of least privilege

Do note that I'm still learning github, and I'm in school, so it may take a while.

## Current issues

Github forces the entire directory to be downloaded to access a branch, greatly mitigating the effectiveness of least privilege, and simple workspace setup

## Possible workarounds

* Setup multiple projects for different pieces of code (may be cumbersome to view, and merge changes.) May be able to have a "master" portfolio to ease viewing, but merging would still likely be cumbersome.
* Create multiple accounts and/or and organization and fork the primary portfolio, with each fork focusing on its own coding branch. May still be hard to merge; much easier to view, gives experience in orgs and github use. In the hypothetical scenario, these forks may be made by those with higher access, and accessed by those who only need that code piece. Much better adherence to least privilege, may still be hard to merge, viewing may be scattered if unable to merge.
